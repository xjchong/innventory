Setup the project! The "specs" for this app are as follows:

1. Create a splash screen with the title of the app, your name and the date.
2. Create a screen that has a 2xn grid of hearthstone card data.

Each item in the grid should have the following data:
a) Name of Hearthstone card
b) Image of Hearthstone card (if a card doesn't have an image, display a placeholder image)
c) Type of Hearthstone card
d) PlayerClass of Hearthstone card

This data should be requested from the following API endpoint:

GET https://omgvamp-hearthstone-v1.p.mashape.com/cards

3. Add an icon to the app's header. When a user taps the icon, a text input should appear that allows the user to search for cards by name. When it appears, it should appear above the grid and can be dismissed. When the user inputs a keyword, and taps search, filter the grid based on the keyword related to the name of the Hearhstone card. When the user dismisses the search, reset the grid.

4. Add unit tests.


## Design


I'll include a rough sketch of what I imagine the app might be designed like in this log. For now, I've implemented a simple splash screen to confirm that the app runs as expected. I've included two pods that will help me handle the API. Since it's my first time using RapidAPI, I am referring to the [guide](https://medium.com/@enricopiovesan/using-rapidapi-and-swift-c44473f874ca) that is linked by RapidAPI that showcases a simple weather app.


Very rough design:

## Architecture

I've thought a little bit about the architecture I'd like to employ for the app. The app is very simple, so it would be fine to follow typical MVC (as Apple intended). However, for the purpose of this application process, I'd like to do something possibly more interesting, and implement some flavour of MVVM instead.

The bare-bones architecture:

## API

Parsing the JSON from the API provided gave me more trouble than I would have liked, to be honest. Normally after I setup API related things, I don't have to think about it too much. Had to refresh on how to take the json/data returned through Alamofire to create the card models I'll need. 

The specs say that only playable cards should be displayed. Keeping that in mind, for now I've just compiled a lit of the playable card sets that I am aware of. I also noticed that some cards don't have player class fields. For now I'm leaving it as optional, but this may indicate that they are actually unplayable cards.


## Strings and Localization

Though the app isn't going to be in multiple languages for the submitted version, I like having my strings sorted out nicely in a way that could be easily localized later. With that in mind, I didn't want to use a pod like R.swift which I'm familiar with. Instead I compromised by creating a Localizable extension that will allow for nice swifty looking string constants in the app. The idea is from [this medium article](https://medium.com/@marcosantadev/app-localization-tips-with-swift-4e9b2d9672c9).


## Next Up

The next steps will be to create card cells and card cell viewmodels to bind to the card models that I've finished today. After that, I can set up the main view with a collection view, and make sure all the cells display nicely. I'll want to have an empty state, and a loading indicator. Pull to refresh would be nice as well. After I do that, I will add the search functionality.

Also, once I've fleshed out the card collection view model a bit more, I'll write unit tests for it before I forget haha.
